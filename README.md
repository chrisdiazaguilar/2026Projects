# 2026 Developer Projects 🚀

A living collection of projects I’m building in 2026 to sharpen my skills, ship real apps, and document my progress as a developer.

> Goal: Consistency + shipping. Small wins → big momentum.

## 📌 What’s in this repo?

This repository contains multiple projects (mini apps, full-stack builds, experiments, and learning challenges).  
Each project has its own folder with source code, notes, and (when applicable) a live demo.
